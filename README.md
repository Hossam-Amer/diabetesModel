# diabetesModel


Diabetes model due to it's small data set and alot of outliers the model was very poor in predicion.
so to solve that i did the following :
1-using linear regression imputaiion for outliers 
2-over sampling to balance the classes

<br>
3- Grid search

these steps led to a significant imporvment in model score
