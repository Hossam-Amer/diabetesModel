# Diabetes Model


Diabetes model due to it's small data set and alot of outliers the model was very poor in predicion.
so to solve that i did the following :
<br>
1-using linear regression imputaiion for outliers 
<br>
2-over sampling to balance the classes
<br>
3- Grid search
these steps led to a significant improvement in model score.
